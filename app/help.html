<h3>Operation and Game Interface</h3>

<h3>Profiles</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First-rate personality profiles consist of a large number of single facts.</li>
  <li>Every dirty detail counts - your database is an intelligent machine which can derive new information from seemingly insignificant details.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<p>Hint: The more complete your data is, the more it’s worth.</p>


</div>

<h3>Your Data Empire</h3>
<ul>
<li>At the center of your empire sits your Data Vault, with your network around it.</li>
<li>Gather profiles: The blue lines lead from your sources into your database.</li>
<li>Sell profiles: Orange lines connect out to the clients who buy your data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hint: You can move and arrange all elements however you like.</p>

<h3>Underworld</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you regularly supply your sources with a little cash, they’ll occasionally cough up small (or large!) packs of profiles.</li>
<li>When you “Collect” profiles from sources they’ll be sent to the Database to await integration.</li>
<li>Your status is only updated once you’ve integrated the new profiles in your database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hint: Before adding a set of profiles to your database, decide which profile attributes you need most at that moment.</p>

<h3>Data tools & online ventures</h3>

<ul>
<li>To keep your ventures active and happily gathering profiles, you need to invest in them regularly.</li>
<li>Upgrade your tool’s capabilities, advertise, and assemble a specialized team. All of these will raise your output of profiles.</li>
<li>Some upgrades earn you new attributes or other benefits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hint: Upgrades usually increase the cost of general operation (the cost to Invest).</p>

<h3>Make Money</h3>

<ul>
<li>Help enterprises, banks, insurance companies, human resource departments and state agencies to make their decisions.</li>
<li>Offer them your database in exchange for a little cash.</li>
<li>Make great deals and watch the money roll in.</li>
<li>The more profiles you have, the more money you make.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hint: Take a look at which attributes your customers are especially interested in.</p>



</div>
<div class="entry">
<img class="helpimg" src="img/help/Datenbank.png" />
<h3>Your database</h3>

<ul>
<li>Your database holds all the profile attributes you’ve gathered so far.</li>
<li>After you’ve collected new profiles from your sources or projects, you need to integrate them in your database!</li>
<li>Once that is done, you will know how many of those profiles are completely new and how many relate to information you already had.</li>
<li>Your database is more than just a powerful data storage device! It’s an intelligent machine that can perfectly tie all that data together.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hint: The orange bar beneath profile attributes shows where you need fresh supplies.</p>



</div>
<div class="entry">
<img class="helpimg" src="img/help/risiko.png" />
<h3>Risk</h3>

<ul>
<li>Is all this data completely legal? Far from it!</li>
<li>Every data source increases your risk. Should your risk factor get too high, the general public, action groups or privacy advocates might become a pain in the neck.</li>
<li>Every data source has a risk factor between 0 and 10, which is added to your overall risk every time you collect from them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hint: Whenever you upgrade a project, check how this will influence your risk.</p>

<h3>Energy & Experience</h3>

<ul>
<li>Each day only has 24 hours, and your energy is limited – make it count!</li>
<li>Don’t worry if your energy runs out again. Just wait a little while and soon you’ll be fit as a fiddle again.</li>
<li>Every action earns you experience and gets you closer to the next level.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hint: If you make it to the next level, the rush of endorphins will pep you up right away.</p>



</div>
<div class="entry">
<h3>Hints for beginners</h3>

<ul>
<li>Select a client and check which profile attributes they need most.</li>
<li>Collect as many profiles as possible with those precise attributes.</li>
<li>This way you can quickly cash in larger and larger sums and gradually expand your empire.</li>
</ul>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2




</div>
<div class="entry">
<h3>Why do I start the game with over a million profiles?</h3>
<p>In our demo, you start in the middle of the game and already have some profiles, attributes, projects and underworld sources.</p>



</div>
<div class="entry">
<h3>Can I save my game progress?</h3>
<p>We’re sorry, but this demo version sadly forgets all your accomplishments as soon as you close your browser window. In the full game, you’ll be able to log in (with or without a Facebook account) and tend to your data empire over a longer period of time even if you decide to take a break now and then.</p>



</div>
<div class="entry">
<h3>Why can’t I get rid of project upgrades?</h3>
<p>We plan to implement this feature in the full game. As already mentioned, this is only a demo. Um. ;)</p>
